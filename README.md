Let me set the records straight. Lewis Hamilton is the GOAT and I will not hear otherwise! 

Now that we have that out of the way, let me tell you a bit about myself <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1520808873/3643/cool-doge.gif?1520808873" width="20" />

* 🖥️ Recently started working as a Software Engineer at State Street.
* 💡 I enjoy writing in-depth solution articles and breaking down complex problems on [LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com), helping others level up their coding skills!
* 🚵🏻‍♂️ Member of the Sac State Cycling Group. Let's ride sometime if you're in the area!
* ⛰️Love exploring off-beat hikes and peaks in California. My absolute favorite:  🥁🥁 <a href="[https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/whitney.htm](https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/whitney.htm)">Mount Whitney</a>
* 😄 Pronouns: He/him
* 🧐 A quirky fact about me: I have a knack for diving deep into explanations, even when a simple answer would do. Over-explaining? Guilty as charged!
